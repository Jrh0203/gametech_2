Assignment 1: Ball in Room

BUILDING
========
Typing "make" while in the root directory should make a build directory along with the executable inside that directory. The executable is named proj1. The executable has dependencies on ogre texture files as well as the skybox but there is a resources.cfg file that handles that in the root directory. In the zip there should already be an executable that is runnable in the root directory.

DESCRIPTION
===========
The project was written according to spec and incorporates all the required functionality. Pressing 'r' resets the ball to the center of the room and randomizes its speed and direction.

EXTRA CREDIT
============
Improved Graphics (1pt). I texture mapped the ball and the walls and added a shadow for the ball. I also added a skybox.

Camera Controls (1pt). WASD moves the camera in the XZ plane and E and Q ascend and descent respectively.
