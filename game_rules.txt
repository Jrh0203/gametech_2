Rules:
Hit a ball back and forth against a computer-controlled opponent. If the ball
passes your opponent, you get a point. Hitting the ball with the wrong color 
paddle gives your opponent a point. The ball color is randomized whenever the 
ball passes the center of the game field. First to 7 points wins!
